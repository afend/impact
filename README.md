# impact
I want to see if there are impactful words in the news that affect stock prices

Step 1:
Get the term frequency of each news artcle in Corpus (which will be full of new stories)

Step 2:
Develop a dictionary of impactful words

Step 3:
See if they have impact based on some financial API I can see the time of the story and the corresponding shift (or lack thereof).

Step 4:
Revist developing a dictionary of impactful words. Repeat steps 3 and 4.

Step 5:
Using Machine Learning, grab stories from a feed and offer the "client" a suggestion based on the impact of that story. Again, the intention is to see a rise in stock price or sell before drop.
